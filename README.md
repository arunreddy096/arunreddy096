I'm Arun Reddy Nalla, a student at the University of Windsor who is pursuing a Master's in Applied Computing. I am looking for a co-op position in May 2023 in software development, testing, and other similar areas in a company where I can use and improve my skill set for the benefit of the organisation. With my creative idea, I aim to create features that can help in the growth of the Company.
